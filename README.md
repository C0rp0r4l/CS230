This Project is the Blueprint for launching the Company U-Maps!
What is U-Maps and why is it important?
As a new student navigating a new campus can be a daunting and exhausting experience, for even veteran students situations with their classes and campus can change. 
We seek to make an app and toolset to allow students to be up to date on what is happening on campus to get to their classes and any other location in the most efficient and accurate way possible while keeping them up to date with any changes on campus that affect them.
We seek to provide this service with a promise to students to respect their privacy and not to gather and sell the tracked data to any outside sources. We wish to serve the students first, not to commodify them.

We hope to have an open collaborative environment where users can submit bug fixes, suggestions, and create modules to integrate into the U-Maps platform ot bring new functionality to the student experience.
